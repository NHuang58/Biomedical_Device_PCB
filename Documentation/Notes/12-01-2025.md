24 hours is a good metric, may run into hardware issues after 24 hours

Hardware restriction 
- Can't run for more than 8 hours:

8 hours -> Charge Battery -> 8 hours -> Charge Battery -> 8 hours
Does this mean we can only do it 3 times

- 24 hours restriction? Look into what this actually means
- Look into more solutions for data storage
    - What if something happens (to GitHub or another company), being able to run a local server would be better?
    - Look at other local options, research local alternatives
    - Write program/executable that I can install on laptop, have data uploaded to local machine
    - Work with Professor Karcher and Omosalewa to run windows based tablet
        - Before too many resources are invested, is there local memory?

- *Keep data being uploaded via bluetooth right now*
- Load data into local device instead of internet
- *Run numbers for data collection*

Work closely with Charles, figure out what the best sensor would be to incorporate into the PCB
- *Figure out sensors that need to be bought, include in Rev. 2-3*
- *Run with Charles the other restrictions, data upload, etc.*
- Once force sensors are bought, circuitry needs to be on the PCB, PCB design changes

Niedra + I can sync up to actually place order
