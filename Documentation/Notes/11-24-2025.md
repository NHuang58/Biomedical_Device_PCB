Concerns with Apple:
- Stuck with propriety product (only for apple products)

Use script to write (MATLAB)?

Agriculture Department should get another device so that maintenance is easier

Solutions:

Craft email to Prof. Karcher, cc. Robert Nawrocki, Omosalewa (3)

- Ask him how to proceed, what is the best way to move forward
- Have budget to buy a device that is portable enough to bring to farm

Call multiple companies to inquiry on sensors

- Look for sensor model email tomorrow (Use as inspiration)


*More that can be done by someone else that expedites development is better
