# To Do

Get PCB made ASAP
Get one person to check PCB from Professor Salas
Email lab meeting chain

Ask mouser or other vendor for what application (resistive vs capacitive) would be better -- Need to see how many changes need to be made

- Capacitive - Charge amplifier
- Resistive - Wheatstone bridge

Work with Niedra to figure out how to place the order
- Form 12
