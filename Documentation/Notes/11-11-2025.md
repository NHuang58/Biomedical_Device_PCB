Where does the obligation lie for the backpack?

Can have perches, 8 hour frame where birds will not move
- Antennas would be close to that proximity

- 1 square foot per bird
- 2 birds -> 4 foot pen

Scalable to whatever it needs to be:

Grant (2-3 days of data collection)
7 days if possible, extend to 21 days maximum

How big of a footprint does the charging need
Is heat dissapation a big issue

Phase 1: Backpack
Phase 2: Surgically Implant it onto the Keel Bone 
- (Maybe cut feathers back)

Phase 3: Developing digital twin of bird and body cavity
- Give digital twin real life data to better understand pressures on Keel Bone

Sensor + Battery Volume + Weight (Send to Omosalewa)
